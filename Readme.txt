Hi!
Here I want to show my solution to the clustering problem. The essence of the task:
We are given a scan of the shell of a cylindrical vessel, on which there are points
of indication of sources of such a method of non-destructive testing as acoustic emission. 
Groups of points are visible in the figure, which, most likely, belong to the same defect.
